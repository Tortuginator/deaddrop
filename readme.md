# deaddrop

A very simple tool to transfer files over HTTP using curl. Intended to be used behind a reverse proxy providing TLS encrypytion.

go build .
./deaddrop
```

You may use `--limit-rate 200K` to limit the upload speed with curl. [Futher information](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/transfers/rate-limiting).

curl localhost:5050 -d@my_file.bin
```
